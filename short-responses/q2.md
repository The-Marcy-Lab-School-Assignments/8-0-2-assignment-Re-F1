# Question

What are environment variables? How do you access them in Node?

# Answer
environment variables are `key-value` pairs configured outside your source code so that each value can change depending on the environment. We access these by installing a .env dependency, then we store private information. Whenevr we need to access the .env file we would use

```js
require('dotenv').config()
const data = process.env.data
```

Great job on explaining what environment variables are! Now, make sure to also address 'How do you access them in Node?' Remember to include the specific way we would access them using the process.env object.

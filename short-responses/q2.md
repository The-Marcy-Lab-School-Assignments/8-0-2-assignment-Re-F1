# Question

What are environment variables? How do you access them in Node?

# Answer
environment variables are `key-value` pairs configured outside your source code so that each value can change depending on the environment. We access these by installing a .env dependency, then we store private information. Whenevr we need to access the .env file we would use

```js
require('dotenv').config()
const data = process.env.data
```

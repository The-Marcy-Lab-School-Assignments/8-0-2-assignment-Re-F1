# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer
The key is exposed, therefore not being private. To avoid this we make a .env. To access an env file in the backend we would have to use tableplus and connect to the database. It is better to request from the server as this would make it more private. A user with a deployed versoin will not have access to it

Great start! Go into more detail on the second part! Explain how we would use the .env file, how we would access it in the back end, and how this would avoid the danger of the api key being public.

# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer
The key is exposed, therefore not being private. To avoid this we make a .env. To access an env file in the backend we would have to use tableplus and connect to the database. It is better to request from the server as this would make it more private. A user with a deployed versoin will not have access to it

Great job!, while you are correct that API requests with API keys from the frontend leads to the key being exposed, you are incorrect on accessing it. To access the .env variables, you would typically use Node.js's process.env to securely read them in a backend server environment, not a database tool like TablePlus
